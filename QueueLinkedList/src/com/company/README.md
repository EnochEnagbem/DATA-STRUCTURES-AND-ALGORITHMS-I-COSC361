#### QUEUE
 Queue is a data structure in which whatever comes first will go out first. It follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) policy. In Queue, the insertion is done from one end known as the rear end or the tail of the queue, whereas the deletion is done from another end known as the front end or the head of the queue.
