#### OVERVIEW
This program is an implementation of the doubly linked list data structure.

This program folder contain the following
- `Main.java`

    This is the entry point of the program and also contain some

    doubly LINKEDLIST methods.

    These methods include:
    - `displayForward()`
    - `insertFirst()`
    - `insertLast()`
    - `insertAfter()`
    - `displayBackward()`
