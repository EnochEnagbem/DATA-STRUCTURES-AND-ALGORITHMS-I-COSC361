#### SINGLY LINKEDLIST
The singly linked list is a linear data structure in which each element of the list contains a pointer which points to the next element in the list. Each element in the singly linked list is called a node. Each node has two components: data and a pointer next which points to the next node in the list. The first node of the list is called as head, and the last node of the list is called a tail
